- I have a patent! Check it out here: https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2022/0202583.html
- The patent is for a glenoid implant, a necessary piece for shoulder arthroplasty (replacement) surgery. We performed testing at smaller scale with 3D printed prototypes and environments to match conditions in the human body. We met and exceeded our sponsors' expectations, and innovated a novel design to apply for a non-provisional patent (as named inventors).

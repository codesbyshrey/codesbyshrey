### Hello! I'm Shreyas 👋

Human Factors Engineer | Biomechanics Specialist | Immersive Interaction Designer

Human-centered product leader with an interdisciplinary background spanning clinical biomechanics, biomedical engineering, and human-factors AI design. Demonstrated ability to make high-stakes decisions under ambiguity, translate complex patient needs to technical action plans, and drive cross-functional teams towards positive clinical outcomes in regulated, high-consequence environments.

Brings formalized intuitions from patient care, user research, and human body-brain dynamics – developed across a deliberate journey from biomedical engineering and orthopedic implant design through emergency medicine and clinical rehabilitation, into software development and AI systems. Contributed across the full PDLC: from research and requirements gathering for broad stakeholder ecosystems, through design and strategy for software and physical interfaces, to implementation via physical prototyping and iterative digital development.
